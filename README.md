Building the SDK
----------------

Add all dependencies of the Mixpanel SDK to your app using the following code in your terminal:

```
sh ./native/build/install_dependencies.sh
```

Make sure you've logged in to the Unity app.

Then, run the following build script in your terminal: 

```
cd build
python build_all.py # on OS X
build_all.py # on Windows
```

Note that Unity must be closed while running build_all.py.

The build script will create all the project files (make, xcode, visual studio), perform the builds and run the tests suites. The test suites are run on: OS X, Windows, iOS Simulator and Android Device (if one is attached).
