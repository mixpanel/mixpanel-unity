      # Note: .NET SDK provides basic C# syntax support for Copilot.
      # This Unity SDK uses Unity-specific APIs (UnityEngine, UnityEditor)
      # that aren't available in standard .NET, so Copilot's type information
      # for Unity-specific code will be limited. However, this still helps with
      # general C# syntax, patterns, and non-Unity code analysis.
